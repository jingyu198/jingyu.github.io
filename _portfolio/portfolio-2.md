A multiscale numerical method is proposed to investigate the coupled conduction radiation heat transfer in C/SiC composites, which can significantly reduce the computational time of reconstructing temperature and radiation intensity fields while ensuring the computational accuracy.<br/><br/>
Investigate 3D convolutional neural networks as a novel approach to predict thermal properties. The networks learn the mapping from sophisticated material microstructures with phase-property, to effective properties at macro-level.<br/><br/>
