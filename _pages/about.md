Hello! My name is Jingyu Guo (郭靖宇). I'm a second year master student in School of Computing at [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) (NUS), advised by Prof. [Jin-Song Dong](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dongjs/). During my master's study, I have dedicated myself to Sports Analytics, with a focus on broadcast tennis videos. I am also broadly interested in exploring various topics in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and their applications.

I got my bachelor's degree from School of Energy and Power Engineering, [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) (XJTU), where I worked with Prof. [Ya-Ling He](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lCIq-10AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).

**I am looking for a PhD position of Spring/Fall 2024. Feel free to email me for potential opportunities.**
